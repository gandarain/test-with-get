# React Props and States

## Props
Prop is a method to pass or access a value from one component into other component.

## States
State is a object to store a data or value. The page or screen will re-render when there are some changes on the state.

## When do you use each
State is used to define a value or data on parent component. If this value is needed for the other component (child component). Pass the state value as a props to the child component.
